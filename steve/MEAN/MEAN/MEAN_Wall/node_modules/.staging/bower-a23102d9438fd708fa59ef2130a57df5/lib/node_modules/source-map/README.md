# Source Map

This is a library to generate and consume the source map format
[described here][format].

This library is written in the Asynchronous Module Definition format, and works
in the following environments:

* Modern Browsers supporting ECMAScript 5 (either after the build, or with an
  AMD loader such as RequireJS)

* Inside Firefox (as a JSM file, after the build)

* With NodeJS versions 0.8.X and higher

## Node

    $ npm install source-map

## Building from Source (for everywhere else)

Install Node and then run

    $ git clone https://fitzgen@github.com/mozilla/source-map.git
    $ cd source-map
    $ npm link .

Next, run

    $ node Makefile.dryice.js

This should spew a bunch of stuff to stdout, and create the following files:

* `dist/source-map.js` - The unminified browser version.

* `dist/source-map.min.js` - The minified browser version.

* `dist/SourceMap.jsm` - The JavaScript Module for inclusion in Firefox source.

## Examples

### Consuming a source map

```js
var rawSourceMap = {
